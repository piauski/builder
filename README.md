# Builder
Simple 3D block game made in C with Raylib.

# Building & Running

Using [Tsoding's nob](https://github.com/tsoding/musializer/blob/7cec0d7707cbee5340e27d69b923236ccbda68bb/src/nob.h), building is as simple as compiling `./src/nob.c` once to bootstrap the build system and running `$ ./src/nob` thereafter. The entire program can be built and run using the following commands:

```
$ cc nob.c -o nob
$ ./nob && ./build/main
```
